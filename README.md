## Introduction
Welcome to Kinshu, a Witcher 1 Enhanced Edition modlist. 

This is a modlist that contains a small amount of mods with the intention of uplifting the game a bit while still being the game of old

[Link to load order for a better idea of what the list contains](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/terra)
## What to expect
- General visual uplifts
- Some much needed QoLs and fixes
- Minor gameplay changes
- Cleaner and configurable user interface


## What not to expect
- Any dramatic departures from the original game in terms of content, gameplay mechanics, etc.


## FAQ
### Why isn't (Insert mod here) included?
Usually I do not include a mod for the following reasons:
- It goes beyond the intention of the list
- It possesses technical and/or compatibility issues
- It is simply something I'm not personally interested in

I am open to suggestions but if you do wish to make one then keep in mind the above criteria

### Can I add/remove mods?
You're welcome to do so and can also use this list as a baseline to build off of if you wish. Keep in mind however that you will need to be responsible for managing conflicts as my help will be limited

Also do keep in mind that setting up mods for W1 in MO2 can be a bit finicky

### Platform Support?
Should be fine on any platform

# Installation
## Pre-Installation
**Base Requirements**
- The Witcher 1 Enhanced Edition
- Latest version of windows 10
- A nexus mods account (Premium is recommended by Wabbajack to automate installation but you can use a free one)
- Latest NVIDIA/AMD/Intel Drivers
- ~2GB of storage space

**MO2 Requirements**
- [Latest Microsoft Visual C++](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)
- [Latest .NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework)

**Setting up The Witcher 1**
- Launch The Witcher 1 at least once. This is to allow it to generate any important files

**Set the game language to English**
This is a temporary measure as Wabbajack requires the english version of the game to work correctly. You can revert the language back after installation

## Wabbajack Installation
**Installing Wabbajack**
Download [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/)
- Extract the file and place it in an easy to access location. DO NOT however place it inside any UAC controlled folders e.g. Program Files, Program Files (x86), Downloads, Documents, etc.
- For reference my wabbajack location is C:\Games\Modding\Wabbajack
- Double click wabbajack.exe and let the program update itself if needed

**Downloading and Installing Kinshu**
Click "Browse Modlists" in Wabbajacks menu as well as "Show Unofficial Lists" and filter by "The Witcher"
find "Terra" in the gallery and click on the arrow button to download the installation file
In the installation window, you will be asked to define the locations of two folders:
- Installation Location which is where Kinshu will be installed. Choose an easy to access folder such as C:\Games\ that is outside UAC protected folders (Program Files, Documents, etc).
- Download Location which is where the downloaded mod archives will be stored. The default location is within MO2s downloads folder but if you want you can set it to an external folde
- Once the folder locations have been set click the button on the right to start installation

Now wabbajack will begin installing the list. If you have a nexus premium account this will be automatic so sit back and wait. If you have a normal account however you will need to download each mod manually. Wabbajack will make this easier for you though by showing the download page instantly, you just need to click download is all

**Troubleshooting Wabbajack**
If Wabbajack idles or fails installation the first thing I would suggest is just restart Wabbajack. It'll pick up right where it left off and you wont lose any progress

If Wabbajack continues to have trouble then I'd suggest joining Aetherius modding (Link in [Contacts](#contacts)) and finding Kinshu's channel to inquire there

## Post-Installation
Open up Mod Organizer 2. Everything should be installed and generally shouldnt require any tweaking unless you plan on modifying the setup

To start the game select The Witcher in the top right drop down menu and click Run. The game should launch quickly

## Updating
Updating is very similar to installing the list. Simply make sure your paths are the same and tick the overwrite existing modlist button. 
Some things to keep in mind:
- Any mods you have added will be deleted when updating.
- Its recommended to back up your saves just in case

## Removing
Simply delete the folder containing the modlist
